## 🛠 Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

- **Power BI Desktop** – Main data visualization and reporting tool  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation layer  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for calculated measures and KPIs  
- **Data Modeling** – Relationships between fact and dimension tables  
- **Time Series Forecasting** – Power BI built-in forecasting feature  
- **File Format** – `.pbix` for development

## 📂 Dataset / Data Source

**Dataset:** SuperStore Sales Dataset (retail transactional dataset)

The dataset contains:
- Order-level sales transactions  
- Customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)

## 🎯 Business Problem

Retail companies generate large volumes of sales data, but raw data alone does not provide meaningful business insights.

Key questions such as:
- Which customer segment generates the most revenue?
- Which product categories are most profitable?
- Which regions and states perform best?
- How do sales and profit change over time?
- What sales can we expect in the near future?

are difficult to answer without a centralized analytical system.

- Tracks key business KPIs  
- Enables product-level and regional analysis

- Generates short-term sales forecasts  
- Supports data-driven decision making
